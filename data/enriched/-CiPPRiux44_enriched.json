    "text": "And he walks in there like the big hero guy. Right, so that's a really interesting story. For me telling other hostage negotiators, that's a story. Why am I telling that to salespeople?

And I sold him a fabulous deal, but with a horrible product. And why did I do that? I never sold him a product at all. Did I? What did I sell him? Dignity? What else? A way out? I sold him, him. I sold him, him. I listened to him. I understood what made him tick. I just gave it back to him.",
