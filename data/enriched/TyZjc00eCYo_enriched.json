    "text": "I'm Kirk and I'm here to bust some negotiation myths. I have used a megaphone many years ago in the seas of Glasgow but I remember the commander telling me that I didn't need the megaphone that my voice was loud enough. Well the strangest demand I've ever had from a hostage taker was during a siege and during the siege there was eight people within the premises and they asked for food to be delivered and of course we arranged for fish and chips to be delivered from a local fish and chip shop and they arrived and within 15 minutes they asked again for food and I couldn't understand why they were asking for food after we had just delivered eight sets of fish and chips and it turned out the firearms team had eaten it on its arrival. The most common demand from hostage takers is for them to ask for usually a cigarette or something but we interpret that as an ability to just take time out and be calm. So most hostage negotiators in the vehicle with them carry cigarettes even if they don't smoke because they realize it's a request and a chance to allow someone to just decompress for five minutes. Well eye contact is important in terms of establishing a relationship but more often than not for me it's about listening because very often in negotiation situations you can't be in direct eye contact with a person because there's perhaps officers with shields between you and them so it's more important that you connect by voice. Well the handshake is really irrelevant of course it's nice to extend a warm welcome but for me the most important thing when you engage someone for the first time is to bring emotion and that emotion should be warmth and positive. No that's nonsense.",

    "text": "In actual fact they teach that you should never exchange hostages for anyone else because if you increase the value of that hostage then you put the hostage negotiators in a more difficult position. Yeah well I used to run both the armed response teams and the hostage negotiation teams and clearly sometimes they both had very different agendas and I think we probably clashed a lot in the beginning but eventually where we cross contaminated both of those disciplines with each other's perspectives then yeah they began to see each other and complement each other very well so I'm pleased to say that the conflict in both those areas got better and better over time. Yes the whole point of negotiation and listening skills is to listen to someone's voice and find discrepancies between what they say, how they say it and how they behave. We call that leverage and so what we do when we hear that and see that is rather than confront that lie we just store that for later use because we'll use it to disarm them or to distract or destabilize their arguments. I always watch negotiation movies and of course most of the things that are made in LA are fantasy and bear no resemblance to the truth but there's actually a scene in the negotiator movie between Samuel L Jackson and Kevin Spacey where they speak about the ending to a movie and although they're speaking about the ending to a movie they're actually talking about something else and I find that's the most common thing in negotiation because people talk about one thing and they're really talking about something else and they expect you to read between the lines so for me that's the closest element that's relevant in most negotiations.",
