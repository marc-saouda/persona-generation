    "text": "So the hostage negotiator training process and the skills, which for me and almost every other hostage negotiator, has a success rate of 99% over, for me, 35 years. Those skills can help people in the corporate world, as an example, when you're negotiating in or out of a contract, you're perhaps faced with an imbalance of power, where your negotiating partner is trying to squeeze or maximize the use of their power. And we can deal with extortion, bring control to that equation, and help move the balance of power in your favor.",
