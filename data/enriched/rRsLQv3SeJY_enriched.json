    "text": "My name is Kirk and I'm a professional negotiator. We define empathy as the recognition and articulation of emotions of other people and the context of that emotion. Common misconception is that people always say, well it's walking in the shoes of other people, but you can't walk in the shoes of other people. My own experience is every time as a young negotiator, going to the edge of a bridge and you're faced with someone with a terrible set of circumstances and perhaps they're speaking about the death of their mother or brother. And when you say something like, I understand how you feel, I've lost my mother or something like that. Usually the feedback you get is, you don't understand anything about me. So being able to walk in the shoes of other people is almost impossible. So we learn really early to say something like, I couldn't even begin to understand how that must feel. And when people feel, you just give them space to express themselves. And you're kind of in the ballpark and you're there with a bit of compassion. Then empathy is the energy that's created in that moment when someone feels heard and understood. And there's a moment in time when they walk away and say, he or she just gets me.",
