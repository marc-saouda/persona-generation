    "text": "So actually, the most effective relationship mode to be in is the combination of both being assertive, hard on the point, soft on the person, and empathetic, recognition and articulation of emotions of others, so that they feel heard and understood. And when people feel heard and understood, when you feel heard and understood, you're then in a position to listen to other people. Because when you're in a debate and you're both launching arguments at each other, no one is listening. It's not a dialogue, it's an interactive monologue. Both people are just saying, I think that, well you think that, I think that, well you think that, and no one's listening. Hostage negotiators learn to shut up and listen.",
